Seriously considering this book as a starting point. Or as one of the starting points…

A couple of weeks ago a tweet by [@maguay](https://twitter.com/maguay/status/476592649395118081) made me visit [Design+Code](http://designcode.io/) and I’ve been thinking about taking advantage of the 50% discount to get my app designing going ever since.

The [Resources](http://designcode.io/learn) list alone is almost worth the entry fee!
