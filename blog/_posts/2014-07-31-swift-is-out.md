> Objective-C always felt like an alien language from the perspective of someone who’s never done iOS development. It’s bulky and long, but thanks to the expressive syntax and world-class documentation, I got used to it and even liked it. Still, that doesn’t change the fact that to new developers, it’s confusing and unfamiliar. Swift solves that. It’s a lot more approachable.

When I first thought about actually doing something with my iOS developer's annual fee and started looking for a way to get me started, everyone seemed to be pointing at [Meng To](https://twitter.com/mengto) and his [amazing book](http://designcode.io). He had already announced the Swift chapter, and that took care of any doubt I might have had (I didn't). A bit later the chapter is ready. Just like that, I have plans for this weekend.
