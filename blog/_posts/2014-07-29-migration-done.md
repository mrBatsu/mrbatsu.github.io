Well, it's done. I've finally managed to migrate the (almost unused) [guezota.tumblr.com](http://guezota.tumblr.com) to GitHub. It's now served at [guezota.github.io](http://guezota.github.io). It seemed like the right thing to do, but I had no idea, still don't, on how to go about doing it.
[GitHub](https://github.com) is still a bit of a mistery, and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a total unknown. In the end I did manage to set the thing up, but it felt like I could mess everything with a missing comma, or something like that. It took me long enough, but it's working, and I'll figure out the rest later.  

The theme I picked, in fact, the theme that made me decide to make the change was [So Simple](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/), a beautiful Jekyll theme by [Michael Rose](https://twitter.com/mmistakes) at [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com).  

I had help along the way, and even then I felt overwhelmed most of the time. Still thinking about the time I moved from Wordpress to Tumblr, because Wordpress felt too much work to keep a silly blog. Yeah, right!  

Some of the places where I got my help:

- [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
- [Setting up Github Pages](http://scottduke.github.io/posts/2014/07/20/Github-pages/)
- [So Simple Theme Setup](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/theme-setup/)
- [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
- [GitHub Pages Help](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)

I now have less excuses to sit around and do nothing.
