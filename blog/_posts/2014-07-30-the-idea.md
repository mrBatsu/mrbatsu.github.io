The time has come for me to decide what I will be building. As with most things I do (or try to do) online serve the dual purpose of learning how to do them, and figuring out how these things that might come in handy in the future, for myself as well as others.

My first project will be an app that showcases a photographer's work. Duh. Hopefully I will learn how to display galleries and provide a way to contact the photographer. Also try to figure out how to embed a Twitter feed, or some other social site feed, maybe Instagram. The blog's content might show up there too, I guess. There will be a couple other features, but nothing but barebones at first. Just learn the basics and apply them.  

It will be a very basic app, I can tell you already, and not destined for sale on the App Store or anywhere else. It's a learning experience, and that's enough.

For this first try I will, obviously, use my own content, as it's [readily available](http://maiquemadeira.com).  

Getting to know XCode already feels like a big task to undertake, and that's just one of the many many steps I'll have to take. As I tend to get sidetracked a lot, and my attention span is now shorter than ever, this should be either fun or painful to watch.
