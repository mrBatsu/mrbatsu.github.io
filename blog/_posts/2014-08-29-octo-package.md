Going through a *GitHub phase* I decided to check the [GitHub store](https://github.myshopify.com) one of these days, prompted by a tweet, or an email, announcing they had the [octocat stickers](https://github.myshopify.com/products/octocat-sticker-sheets) back on the shop. I had to get some of those. And, while at it, why not get a nice mug to have my tea at the office ?

I tried not to think too much about it, and today the package arrived. Nice way to end the week, even better when the week felt like hell. Roadie, my MacBook Air has a new sticker, and I'm guessing the iPad Mini (Jeeves) will get one as well. Too big for the iPhone, or one would end up there as well.  

The stickers are extra-strong, it seems like they're made of some sort of plastic-like substance, sturdy little things.

If you're wondering about the wallpaper on the iPhone, I came upon it on dribbble. It's made by Mr. [Jason Long](https://dribbble.com/jasonlong) and you can find it [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/757886-Pixelcat-iPhone-Wallpaper). Love it.

Glad to have you home, :octocat:
