I was a happy user of [Unblock-us](https://www.unblock-us.com) for a loooong time. But I've been using it less and less, I can't find the time to keep up with the latest on Hulu. I've kept the account around, paying for it every month, because it really is a great service, and a cheap one at that. It worked without a glitch for as long as I've been a user, and I've recommended it to a lot of people. Even if I just watched 30 minutes of some series a month, I couldn't bring myself to cancel the account.

Yesterday I came upon another one of those cool [The Sweet Setup](http://thesweetsetup.com) posts that always end up with me spending money somewhere. This time around the article is called [The best VPN solution for iOS and OS X](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-vpn-solution-ios-os-x/), and it broke my relationship with Unblock-US.  

At the end of the review, summing it up: 

> Cloak and TunnelBear each have 2 distinct advantages. TunnelBear is cheaper on the unlimited plan, but Cloak has the auto-connect feature.

I also like the fact the TunnelBear let's you pick (just like I did with my previous VPN provider) where you're tunnelling TO... Handy if you use Netflix. In the end I could not justify paying more for a service that would not be as useful. You can already *whitelist*/*blacklist* domains with [IntelliBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/company/intellibear/) and auto-connect is coming soon, or so we're told.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/bradleychambers">@bradleychambers</a> Thanks for the review! <a href="http://t.co/ptXu8Ht4Lz">http://t.co/ptXu8Ht4Lz</a>â€¦ Note, TunnelBear does auto-connect on PC, OSX and Android -iOS coming soon!</p>&mdash; TunnelBear (@theTunnelBear) <a href="https://twitter.com/theTunnelBear/statuses/504290572807725056">August 26, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At the moment you can pick from the following location list, but can also cast a vote on [where you think they should tunnel to next](https://www.tunnelbear.com/vote/).

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Germany
- Japan
- Australia
- France
- Italy
- Netherlands

Price-wise I picked a Grizzly, as I prefer the cheaper yearly plans, and not having to worry about paying every month. It's still on the same ballpark as the old VPN, but you can [test the system for free](https://www.tunnelbear.com/pricing/). The free Little Bear will help you get acquainted with the service, and has a 500MB cap. You can easily add a full GB to that every month, [with a tweet](https://www.tunnelbear.com/twitter-promo/).  

If you decide to try it out, and I see no reason why you should not want to keep your stuff private, and you like to help test stuff, pay the [Science Division](https://www.tunnelbear.com/volunteer/) a visit.  

UPDATE: I can now occasionally pretend that I'm in Tokyo.
