Another issue I've had for quite some time: Apple Maps. I'd love to love them, but they make that really hard. A year ago, while we were on a [miniTugaTour](https://www.flickr.com/photos/maique/sets/72157635055841723/), we came across the Alqueva Dam and Lake.

It's been ready since 2002, lake full over two years ago. I couldn't believe Apple Maps was so so lost, when the roads were gone, underwater, and we were still being asked to drive there. When we were back home, a [quick post](http://b.xanato.net/post/58527186469/a-little-rant-about-apple-maps-how-can-apple-miss) went up.  

A year has gone by, the dam is still there, the water very much so as well. Has Apple Maps fixed this one in the mean time ? Hmmm ? Maybe getting ready for iOS 8 and Yosemite ?

Can't say they have. Amazingly they have it right on the satelite view, and still soooo wrong on the actual map view. I guess it's back to [Sygic](https://www.sygic.com/en) for now.
