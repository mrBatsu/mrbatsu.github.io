[Yo](http://www.justyo.co) just got updated. Yo!

Test post, to check if my feed updates are going through [RSS 2 Yo](http://rssyo.com)'s service, and Yo-ing people left and right as soon as there's an update over here.  

As I was saying, Yo just got an update, and there's a couple of new features with it: you can now show an avatar and real name, that shows up when people swipe your user, and you can also send a Yo to a hashtag, and check if it [trends](http://www.justyo.co/trending/) or not... Meh.  

What I find useful is the [Yo Index](http://www.yoindex.com), a repository of available Yo services. It keeps growing. You can even get a Yo every time it gets a new service added. Try [sending it a Yo](http://www.justyo.co/YOINDEX/)...  

If, by any chance, you'd like to get a Yo when guezota.github.io has something new, feel free to [Yo me](http://www.justyo.co/GUEZOTA/).  

Enjoy.
