Hey there.

First post, sort of an ‘Hello, World’.

Around 25 to 30 years ago, I did some programming, albeit very basic one, and even considered having a life as a software developer. That’s before deciding photography would be much nicer, with a lot of time spent outdoors, instead of the hermit-like life of a coder.

Anyway, some of that early enthusiasm has lived this far, and when [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) was announced earlier this week, I thought about doing something with my developer’s fee, other than downloading the iOS betas..

So I’m giving this swift thing a go, and can already tell I might be too old and… well… lived, to get too far. But that’s not the point, really, and I’m actually curious to see how far this goes.

For now I went and got the very official [The Swift Programming Language](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11) for iBooks. It doesn’t seem as dense as the books from back in the day but, again, my memory is sooo much worse than before.

Another source of friendly tutorials is [swiftdevs.co](http://swiftdevs.co/) (nothing to see here yet), and their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZuwF7Hfc5s8o_yuMcifyng) (already something to see here).

Bookmarked to read are Global Nerdy’s [collection of links and posts](http://www.globalnerdy.com/2014/06/03/swift-kick-resources-for-getting-started-with-the-swift-programming-language/), and [Jameson Quave](https://twitter.com/jquave)'s six-part [Developing iOS Apps Using Swift](http://jamesonquave.com/blog/developing-ios-apps-using-swift-tutorial/) Tutorial. If I get through these alive I’ll surprise even myself.

Thanks to those youtube tutorials, there’s already a very simple app, with a webview. It’s not that great, but it sure feels good. I also managed to figure out how to get the app icon working, and realised I should probably also get to know xcode a little better before embarking on such a hard and long trip.
