After trying a few other editors over the years, it was time to try Sublime Text, after all the good things I've heard about it. I did try Atom before that, for the GitHub integration, but found it a bit slow and wonky. I then found out [SublimeGit](https://sublimegit.net), and that was that.  

And I was just getting started. Also available is [Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text 2](https://courses.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/), a bit old, and for Sublime Text 2, but it does show you the way around.
