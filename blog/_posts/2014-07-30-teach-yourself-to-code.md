> Don’t believe people who say that learning to code is easy. Better to go in knowing that it’s hard and frustrating and that most of the time you will feel like you have no idea what you’re doing. There are a lot of people who will help you, at Meetups or on StackOverflow. But if you don’t know where to start, I made this site for you.
