I was supposed to be doing my app during the recent days off / vacations. Better, I was supposed to **learn** how to build my app. What did I do with my time ?

Not much, it seems.

I was, as usual, sidetracked by a ton of stuff: Instapaper/Pocket, Kindle, Twitter, photowalking and whatnot.

Coding ? Next to nothing. Learning how to code ? Meh.

It's hard to get into that mindset after all these years when I didn't have to do, or think about, any of these things. I'm from an era where Pascal was alive and C+ the new kid on the block. 8086 Assembler was a cool thing to know. I feel totally lost most of the time, and there's so much to do and learn. Also finding it much harder to concentrate on these subjects. It's the opposite of what I do these days and I can also very much feel the years that have gone by. It will not be easy, that's for sure.

Back to today, the only *coding* I did during this whole time was a [Yo](http://www.justyo.co) app. A way to use the [Yo API](https://medium.com/@YoAppStatus/yo-developers-api-e7f2f0ec5c3c), and test it. Now I have a cool way to notify people when [maiquemadeira.com](maiquemadeira.com) gets updated, but the site is rarely updated anyway, so there's really no point. It works, and I'm glad it does, but that's it.  

I followed apitool's tutorial, [Develop Your First Yo App With APItools](https://docs.apitools.com/2014/07/15/develop-your-first-yo-app-with-apitools.html) and even that was a challenge since I don't know the first thing about JavaScript. It was mostly a copy/paste job and thankfully the tutorial was pretty straightforward. A tip from a real coder took care of the part that was not. I'm also considering going back to [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and take care of the [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) portion of the site.

Closing this one, I have to say I'm in love with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Super cool way of testing stuff while you're learning. You can host everything on GitHub, and have the pages served from there. And it's free! What else can you wish for ? Learn, build and test things without spending a dime ? That's a lot these days. I'm stoked to be using it, and even sprang for a Micro account. Worth it ? We'll see.
