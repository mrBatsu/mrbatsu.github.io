Now that I've made up my mind, again, and decided to post nerdier stuff over here, there's a few things I'd like to test. Today I'm importing a couple of posts from the close-to-abandoned [bSides](http://b.xanato.net). It's been left to die at Tumblr, maybe the move will revive it.  

First one, Editorial. I use this one a lot on the iPad, and posted [this](http://b.xanato.net/post/58684743283/editorial) over at bSides a year ago. It still stands.

Enjoy! <a href="http://t.co/ZxzL9Y9GCU">http://t.co/ZxzL9Y9GCU</a></p>&mdash; Ole Zorn (@olemoritz) <a href="https://twitter.com/olemoritz/statuses/368743932105990144">August 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

Having a ton of fun with [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) and it all started with this giant review by Mr [Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci) - [Reinventing iOS Automation: Editorial Review](http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/)
