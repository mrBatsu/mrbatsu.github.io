One page you can count on, and come back for a weekly selection of links, is [The best resources for learning iOS design and Xcode](http://designcode.io/learn), by the incomparable [Meng To](https://twitter.com/mengto).

Everything you might need to develop your first app is linked here. Sketch, Xcode, Prototyping, Typography, Icon Design and a ton of other subjects. On top of the more *permanent* links, Meng To updates the page every week. You can also subscribe to the newsletter and get the weekly inspiration delivered to your inbox. Very much worth it.
