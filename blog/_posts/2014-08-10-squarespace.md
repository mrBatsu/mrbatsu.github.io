There's not a lot to see, at the moment, but we've set the foundations for what's to come.  

A friend needed help with a website. He wanted a domain registered, he wanted to host it at Squarespace, and he also needed the domain to have a mail account associated with it.

It should have been an easy thing but, before we started the day, this is the situation we had to work with:

- The domain was already registered, by us, a long time ago
- Hosting was handled by DreamHost, with a Wordpress install serving a very generic site
- Mail was set up at Google, but not being used and the password long forgotten
- There was also an account already set up at Squarespace, ready to receive the new site

All we had to do was:

- Upgrade the [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com) account
- Go to [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com) and redirect the site to Squarespace 
- Open a new [Fastmail.fm](https://www.fastmail.fm) account and set it up to handle the domain's mail

Going back and forth, adding CNAME records, and MX records and whatnot, waiting for the dreaded DNS propagation, we had a busy afternoon.
A couple of hours and hundred dollars later, we had [the thing](http://ruigaudencio.com) up and running.  
There's not a lot to see, yet. Hopefully there will be, soon.
